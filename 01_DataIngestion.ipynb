       "120911    It appears that nothing is beyond the pale for this \"fake\" president. I use the word \"fake\" with purpose, as he certainly is not representing the office as a service to the people, the image of America in the world, nor the betterment of mankind.  So far I only see him diminishing our national banks account with the needless extravagances to support his own image and fill his own coffers, exploiting his powers to play an imperial majesty, and destroying our national honor to protect his fragile ego.  The ink was barely dry on election day when he already was scheduling rallies with his base to try to insure re-election in 2020. He has declared the press and over half of American voters as enemies, and embraced hooligans, despots and murderous dictators as allies.  He denies the press access to the Oval Office, yet entertains spies from countries that are not our allies. He stirred unfortunate Americans into an angry mob to build an army of supporters, and then has proceeded to sign executive orders and promote legislation that will further harm them. The man and his minions are beneath our respect, and I cannot call him Mr. President, for that would diminish those who came before him in service to their country.\n",

Conversely, so should Mitch McConnell, his Times has come and gone, he forces people his own age to retire while he goes on being a Senator.The Senator's ideas, and ways of thinking are no longer mainstream, he hasn't the political will or the intestinal fortitude that it will take to keep his president from running this country into the ground. It's time that our elected representatives have term limits imposed. Mitch McConnell was raised in a white mans world, where women were excluded. Even though he never throughly supported Trump. Yet, his wife gets a cabinet appointment, the GOP leadership lead by McConnell, strips down the only department that makes any real sense was the independent ethics board. Under the guise of how much better, how much more stream line, the ethics complaints will be handled. Essentially, setting it up for their president to enrich himself as he always had, and does, only no ethics rules won't apply anymore. More and more this isn't a country by the people and for the people. No it's becoming a country of the have and have nots, and us being the have nots, will shortly have lots less.The Democrats would be right in using  the emolument clause and the constitutional issues Trump will bring, against the GOP, offer them as much help as they offered Obama, and by extension us the citizens of this country.</td>\n",

       "3  The picture in this article is the face of congressional leadership. It would seem that only Harry Reid seemed to know that his time has passed. Conversely, so should Mitch McConnell, his Times has come and gone, he forces people his own age to retire while he goes on being a Senator.The Senator's ideas, and ways of thinking are no longer mainstream, he hasn't the political will or the intestinal fortitude that it will take to keep his president from running this country into the ground. It's time that our elected representatives have term limits imposed. Mitch McConnell was raised in a white mans world, where women were excluded. Even though he never throughly supported Trump. Yet, his wife gets a cabinet appointment, the GOP leadership lead by McConnell, strips down the only department that makes any real sense was the independent ethics board. Under the guise of how much better, how much more stream line, the ethics complaints will be handled. Essentially, setting it up for their president to enrich himself as he always had, and does, only no ethics rules won't apply anymore. More and more this isn't a country by the people and for the people. No it's becoming a country of the have and have nots, and us being the have nots, will shortly have lots less.The Democrats would be right in using  the emolument clause and the constitutional issues Trump will bring, against the GOP, offer them as much help as they offered Obama, and by extension us the citizens of this country.   \n",

It's time that our elected representatives have term limits imposed. Mitch McConnell was raised in a white mans world, where women were excluded. Even though he never throughly supported Trump. Yet, his wife gets a cabinet appointment, the GOP leadership lead by McConnell, strips down the only department that makes any real sense was the independent ethics board. Under the guise of how much better, how much more stream line, the ethics complaints will be handled. Essentially, setting it up for their president to enrich himself as he always had, and does, only no ethics rules won't apply anymore. More and more this isn't a country by the people and for the people. No it's becoming a country of the have and have nots, and us being the have nots, will shortly have lots less.The Democrats would be right in using  the emolument clause and the constitutional issues Trump will bring, against the GOP, offer them as much help as they offered Obama, and by extension us the citizens of this country.</td>\n",

       "3  The picture in this article is the face of congressional leadership. It would seem that only Harry Reid seemed to know that his time has passed. Conversely, so should Mitch McConnell, his Times has come and gone, he forces people his own age to retire while he goes on being a Senator.The Senator's ideas, and ways of thinking are no longer mainstream, he hasn't the political will or the intestinal fortitude that it will take to keep his president from running this country into the ground. It's time that our elected representatives have term limits imposed. Mitch McConnell was raised in a white mans world, where women were excluded. Even though he never throughly supported Trump. Yet, his wife gets a cabinet appointment, the GOP leadership lead by McConnell, strips down the only department that makes any real sense was the independent ethics board. Under the guise of how much better, how much more stream line, the ethics complaints will be handled. Essentially, setting it up for their president to enrich himself as he always had, and does, only no ethics rules won't apply anymore. More and more this isn't a country by the people and for the people. No it's becoming a country of the have and have nots, and us being the have nots, will shortly have lots less.The Democrats would be right in using  the emolument clause and the constitutional issues Trump will bring, against the GOP, offer them as much help as they offered Obama, and by extension us the citizens of this country.   \n",
